        "Stress is the force applied to a material per unit area, causing deformation or change in shape. It's expressed in units of force divided by area, such as Pascals (Pa) or Newtons per square meter (N/m^2). Strain, on the other hand, is the measure of deformation or change in length relative to the original length of the material. It's dimensionless and typically expressed as a percentage or in units of length per unit length (e.g., millimeters per meter). Stress and strain are related by the material's modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus), which describes its stiffness and resistance to deformation under stress.",

If you apply a small force, the rubber band stretches slightly, resulting in low stress and strain. However, if you apply a larger force, the rubber band stretches further, experiencing higher stress and strain. Understanding the relationship between stress and strain is essential in designing and analyzing mechanical components to ensure they can withstand expected loads and deformations without failure.",
